# Stage Zero Health: Comprehensive Master Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

Stage Zero Health represents a paradigm shift from population-based cancer risk assessment to personalized, narrative-driven detection planning. This master plan integrates genetic testing capabilities, progressive model revelation, comprehensive data collection, and systematic learning validation into a unified platform that transforms how individuals understand and manage their cancer risk.

**Core Innovation**: We progressively reveal traditional risk model limitations while building a complete personal narrative that enables truly personalized detection plans, creating a compelling 10-week journey that users value and complete.

**Strategic Vision**: Move from risk assessment platform to comprehensive cancer detection service, establishing Stage Zero as the gold standard for personalized cancer risk management.
