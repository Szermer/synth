## **Progressive Model Education Strategy**

Each week builds understanding while revealing limitations:

- **Week 1**: GAIL baseline + "this is just the beginning"
- **Week 2**: Enhanced GAIL + family context limitations
- **Week 3**: Tyrer-Cuzick introduction + implementation assumptions
- **Week 4**: Healthcare reality check + access barriers

- **Week 7**: Current health + detection readiness
- **Week 8**: Support systems + implementation feasibility
- **Week 9**: Values integration + personalization needs
- **Week 10**: Complete integration + true personalization

This structure creates a compelling narrative arc that demonstrates why comprehensive assessment is essential while building clinical credibility and user engagement throughout the journey.
